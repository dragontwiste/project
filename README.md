# project: Food Ingredient Analyzer
Description:
Developed an innovative Food Ingredient Analyzer application utilizing image processing and text recognition techniques.
This project enables users to snap pictures of food packaging, extract and analyze the ingredient list, and determine if the food product contains any ingredients that are considered "haram" (forbidden) in Islamic dietary practices. 
The system compares the extracted ingredients against a predefined list of haram ingredients, providing users with a quick and reliable assessment of the food's compliance with dietary restrictions. 
The project is hosted on GitHub, allowing for easy access and collaboration with the developer community.
